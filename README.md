Casella's Interview Test Program
Instructions:
Upon Running the web applicaiton you will be met with a main screen with a link saying Interview Program, Click on this.
Upon Clicking on the link it will bring you to a secondary page containing two text fields.
The first one will contain the file name of what you are entering. Be aware that the output file will be that filename plus "frequency.JSON"
The second text field is where you are to enter the directory for the file, which the program will calculate the frequency of the words
When you click on the submit button you it will reload the same screen, minus the text you entered. In the debug folder of the applicaiton the new JSON file will be found.

Upon testing of the program with various examples including the included short paragraph on the instructions all the way up to the United States Constitution,
I came across no errors. This does not guarantee that this program is 100% error free. I was unable to cause any to occur.

At this time I am unsure of the limitations of the file regarding file size.
